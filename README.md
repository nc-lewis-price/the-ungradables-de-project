# the-ungradables-de-project

A fantastic group effort collaborating on this wonderful group project

## Setup

Run `make requirements` first to create venv and install requirements.

Then run `make install-dev-tools` to install requirements for code quality checks. This is required to then run `make run-checks` which will run unit tests, security checks and pep8 compliance checks.

Security checks require `src` and `test` directories to go smoothly so dummy files have been made called `main_replace_me.py` and `test_replace_me.py` until more file structure is created.

`requirements.txt` will need further requirements added as we go along.
